# hello-world
<p>Here begins my exploration to better serve our Shopify needs
I am going to start with manipulating the new Dawn 2.0 theme and their Product Reviews App</p>
<ul><li>Dawn - https://github.com/Shopify/dawn</li>
  <li>Product Review - https://github.com/Shopify/product-reviews-sample-app</li>
<li><a href="https://shopify.dev/apps/tools/cli">Shopify CLI:</a> A command-line tool to scaffold and manage Shopify apps.</li>
<li><a href="https://shopify.dev/apps/tools/app-bridge">App Bridge:</a> A JavaScript library to streamline embedding an app in the Shopify admin.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/shopify/shopify_app">Shopify App Generator for Rails:</a> A Rails engine for building Shopify apps.</li></ul>
